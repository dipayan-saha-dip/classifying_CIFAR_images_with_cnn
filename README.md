# Classifying CIFAR images with the help of CNN

The CIFAR-10 dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is composed of 60,000 color images that are 32x32 pixels in size. These images are categorized into 10 different classes, with each class having 6,000 images. The dataset is further divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

To be more specific, the dataset is split into five training batches and one test batch. Each batch contains 10,000 images. The test batch is made up of 1,000 randomly selected images from each class. On the other hand, the training batches consist of the remaining images in a random order. It is important to note that some training batches may have a higher number of images from one class compared to another. However, when combined, the training batches contain exactly 5,000 images from each class.
